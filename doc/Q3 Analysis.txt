When Comparing the plots of the GA, Random Search, RLS and the (1+1) algorithms, noticeable trends started to form. Across all the graphs, Random Search consistently performed the worst, as it has the slowest growth and large variance. This behaviour was expected due Random Search blindly sampling solutions without any feedback, leading to a lack of problem-driven exploration. In contrast, RLS and the (1 + 1) algorithm improved steadily, showing convergence on functions like F1 and F3, where the simple bit-flip mutation aligns well with the algorithms. 

However, the GA frequently consistently matched or got higher fitness scores within the same budget. In functions with misleading fitness gradients or multimodal structure like F18 and F24, the GA benefitted from maintaining a diverse population and applying uniform crossover, which helped prevent premature convergence, The plots also show narrow error bands on the GA, which can help suggest more stable performance across runs. 

While RLS and the (1 + 1) algorithm showed to be competitive, especially in F2, the provided consistency provided through the population and crossover mechanics allowed the GA to perform at a higher rate than the rest of the algorithms.
