Exercises 1 through to 4 can be ran via problem_example.py, which uses a function get_algorithm that expects
the first argument from the command line to be the name of one of the four algorithms (RLS, EA, MMAS, MMAS*). 
For example, "python problem_example.py MMAS" will run our MMAS implementation from exercise 4. 


Exercise 5 is ran separately via run_aco.py (i.e., "python run_aco.py").
