    - Exercise 1
        Created GitHub Project and ran the corresponding functions, uploaded the data to IOHanalyzer and produced 3 fixed-budget plots in Exercise 1 plots.pdf
    - Exercise 2
        Implemented algorithms RLS and (1+1) EA as functions.
        Ran RLS and (1+1) EA on the listed problems with problem size n = 100 for 100000 iterations.
        Produced a fixed-budget plot for each function showing the mean and standard deviation for the three algorithms
