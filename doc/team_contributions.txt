    - Exercise 4
        Completed implementations of the MMAS and MMAS* algorithms, ran ten times on 
        the same problems used in exercise 2 with a budget of 100000 and n = 100 (also as per exercise 2). 
        Created plots for each evaporation rate (1, 0.1, 0.01) which compare the convergences of MMAS and MMAS*

    - Exercise 1
        Created GitHub Project and ran the corresponding functions, uploaded the data to IOHanalyzer and produced 3 fixed-budget plots in Exercise 1 plots.pdf
    - Exercise 2
        Implemented algorithms RLS and (1+1) EA as functions.
        Ran RLS and (1+1) EA on the listed problems with problem size n = 100 for 100000 iterations.
        Produced a fixed-budget plot for each function showing the mean and standard deviation for the three algorithms

    - Exercise 5
	The load and execute for run_ACO.py. Used F4 instead of F23 in exsersise2 since F23 is buggy at moment.
	The compare function for ACO and MMAS and MMAS*.
	A function that saves the output from run_ACO.py and run_compare.py
